### Introduction
A container is an environment which is set in an operating system whereby one or more applications can run for the application to function smoothly those resources must be necessary.
 A container management this is the use of tools for automation of the scaling of application ,deployment, and creation.
  It is responsible for maintaining and  governing container software, 
  virtual machines it is also called an image, it works just as an actual computer. A software which is in the virtual machine cannot tamper with the computer nor can it escape. 


LXD is a highly effective container manager. It provides an individual experience same as that offered by virtual machines. LXD systems are unique because they operate with Linux containers. This technology was introduced by Canonical Ltd alongside other contributors. LXD is supported by numerous Linux distributions. One of the significant pillars of LXD is a powerful REST API.

### Goal
This article discusses the key features of LXD, the benefits, as well as its releases. 

### Understanding what LXD entails
LXD is a lightweight container manager which operates in the same way as a virtual machine. It does not require a Linux kernel and CPU hardware virtualization.
Linux kernel is the foundation of the Linux operating system.It acts as an interface between different processes and computer hardware. On the other hand, hardware virtualization refers to the process of abstraction which uses software in the computation of resources.

LXD containers are more advantageous as compared to virtual machines. This is because the server can support more processes than virtual containers. LXD offers a hypervisor that helps to manage the life cycle of containers effectively.Hypervisor is responsible for running and creating virtual machines. Furthermore, LXD containers are easy to control since all operations are done via a REST API. This means that accessing a remote server or the local host is seamless.
REST API allows developers to exploit existing protocols.for instance companies can access different resources via a RESTFUL API.

### Key features of LXD
- LXD Containers are image-based. This is effectively achieved by a variety of Linux distributions worldwide. LXD has a built-in image store. This allows the user or other tools to import images. LXD and Docker use different technologies. LXD utilize both virtual machines and container which allows the user to access numerous benefits. Docker relies more on container runtime applications which only support one process per Docker container.


- Linux containers possess great storage management. This is ideal for its multiple storage, pools, and volumes. Another feature is the device passthrough. Some of these components include block devices, Unix character paths, discs, NICs, GPU, and USB. Linux containers perform well in network management. The key activities in network management include configuration, creation of a network bridge, and the use of cross-host tunnels.
- LXD containers are quite secure. This is quite advantageous, especially in the modern world where cyber threats are on the rise. LXD’s built-in security features include resource restrictions and unprivileged containers. Resource restrictions limit how users access containers. This means that unauthenticated individuals cannot access the core system. Unprivileged containers ensure that users only have control over containers that they own. 
- LXD containers are scalable. They can, therefore, accommodate many users and computations nodes. 
- LXD containers are intuitive and simple. They utilize a powerful and clear API. It is easy for inexperienced users to make maximum use of these systems. The command line is also simple to use.
- Support for image transfer and cross host containers is another great feature of LXD. These containers support live migration. 
- LXD containers possess advanced resource control. This is supported by kernel resources, disk usage, memory, and CPU.     

### Benefits of LXD
- security – LXD containers are secure due to their design which is ideal in this modern world where cybercrime is on the rise. The secure features give users confidence while interacting with these containers. LXD containers have resource restrictions that prevent unauthenticated access.
- Availability- LXD containers are accessible worldwide. They work on any Linux distribution. In Ubuntu, LXD containers help in maintaining data upstream directly. LXD containers also deal with snap package publishing which is later used in popular Linux distributions. data upstream refers to the process of uploading data that is transfering data from the client to the the server.snap package publishing is modern format packaging application which can be installed and downloaded by a use of command-line program. 
- Scalable- LXD containers are widely preferred over other containers because they can accommodate many users and computational nodes.
-Simple - LXD containers possess a clear REST API yet very powerful. Inexperienced users prefer these systems since they can make maximum utilization with little knowledge.  
- Storage management- Linux containers have been in a great position to counter storage management problems. This feature is supported by the availability of multiple volumes, pools, and storage.

### LXD’s releases
LXD has two major releases. They include:
-  LTS releases. 
- Feature releases. 

LXD 4.0 is supported until June 2025. The only frequent changes are security updates and bugfixes. However, LXD containers do not support additional features. 
Feature releases are launched monthly. They have new attributes just as same as bugfixes. Canonical LTD supports the software by releasing regular updates. Companies and developers can consult Canonical Ltd in case of any issues

### Conclusion
To sum up, LXD containers have great features compared to traditional Linux containers. LXD containers have significant benefits including better security and scalability. Furthermore, they inherit powerful features from unprivileged containers. LXD containers are equipped with a powerful REST API which helps users easily access what they want to use. Traditional containers are complex to use. LXD releases have also made it stand out. Besides, they are launched more often. LXD containers accommodate more servers compared to other virtual containers thus, making them more preferable to users. Accessibility to Linux distributions worldwide is also a key feature. Besides, the availability of multiple storage volumes and pools make them suitable for many systems. I would highly recommend the use of LXD container managers.
