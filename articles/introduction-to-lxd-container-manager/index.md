### Introduction
A container refers to an environment in an operating system that allows applications to function smoothly, as well as access crucial resources. Containers are quite useful when it comes to creating, scaling, and deploying applications. Developers can also maintain systems easily through the use of containers.

A virtual machine is an essential concept when it comes to using containers. Virtual machines follow specific computer architectures which allows them to provide unique functionalities replicating a real machine. For instance, a user can test out a new operating system by installing it in a virtual machine.

LXD is a highly effective container manager. It provides an individual experience same as that offered by virtual machines. However, LXD systems are unique because they operate with Linux containers.

This technology was introduced by Canonical Ltd. alongside other contributors. LXD is supported by numerous Linux distributions. One of the significant pillars of LXD is a powerful REST API.

In this article, we are going to discuss the key features of LXD, the benefits, and its releases.

### Understanding what LXD entails
LXD is a lightweight container manager which operates the same way as a virtual machine. However, it does not require a Linux kernel and CPU hardware virtualization.

[Linux kernel](https://www.kernel.org/) is the foundation of the Linux operating system. It acts as an interface between different processes and computer hardware.

On the other hand, [hardware virtualization](https://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/hardware-virtualization) refers to the process of abstraction which uses software in the computation of resources.

LXD containers are more advantageous as compared to virtual machines. This is because the server can support more processes than virtual containers. LXD offers a hypervisor that helps to manage the life cycle of containers effectively.

A [hypervisor](https://www.vmware.com/topics/glossary/content/hypervisor) is responsible for running and creating virtual machines. Furthermore, LXD containers are easy to control since all operations are done via REST APIs. This means that accessing a remote server or the local host is seamless.

A [REST API](https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/api/what-is-a-rest-api) allows developers to exploit existing protocols. For instance, companies can access different resources via a RESTful API.

### Key features of LXD
1. LXD Containers are image-based. This is effectively achieved by a variety of Linux distributions worldwide. LXD has a built-in image store that enables users or other tools to import images.
> Note that: LXD and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) use different technologies. LXD utilizes both virtual machines and container technology, which allows the user to access numerous benefits. Docker relies more on container runtime applications which only support one process per Docker container.
2. LXD containers possess great storage management. This is ideal for its multiple storage, pools, and volumes. 
3. Another feature is the device passthrough. Some of the involved components include [block devices](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/259193/what-is-a-block-device), Unix character paths, discs, NICs, GPU, and USB.
4. LXD containers perform well in network management. The key activities in network management include configuration, creation of a network bridge, and the use of cross-host tunnels.
5. LXD containers are quite secure. This is quite advantageous, especially in the modern world where cyber threats are on the rise. LXD’s built-in security features include resource restrictions and unprivileged containers. Resource restrictions limit how users access containers. This means that unauthenticated individuals cannot access the core system. Unprivileged containers ensure that users only have control over containers that they own.
6. LXD containers are scalable. They can, therefore, accommodate many users and computation nodes.
7. They are intuitive and simple. They utilize a powerful and clear API. It is easy for inexperienced users to make maximum use of these systems. The command line is also simple to use.
8. Support for image transfer and cross host containers is another great feature of LXD. These containers support live migration.
9.  LXD containers possess advanced resource control. This is supported by kernel resources, disk usage, memory, and CPU.

### Benefits of LXD
#### Security
LXD containers are secure due to their design which is ideal in this modern world where cybercrime is on the rise. The secure features give users confidence while interacting with these containers. LXD containers have resource restrictions that prevent unauthenticated access.

#### Availability
LXD containers are accessible worldwide. They work on any Linux distribution. In Ubuntu, LXD containers help in maintaining data upstream directly.

> Data upstream is the process of transferring data from the client to the server.

LXD containers also deal with snap package publishing which is later used in popular Linux distributions.

> Snap package publishing is a modern format packaging application that can be installed and downloaded through a command-line program.

#### Scalability
LXD containers are widely preferred over other containers because they can accommodate many users and computational nodes.

#### Simplicity
LXD containers possess a clear REST API yet very powerful. Inexperienced users prefer these systems, since they can make maximum utilization with little knowledge.

#### Storage management
Linux containers have been in a great position to counter storage management problems. This feature is supported by the availability of multiple volumes, pools, and storage.

### LXD’s releases
LXD has two major releases. They include:
1. LTS releases
2. Feature releases

The current `LTS release` is `LXD 4.0` which is supported until June 2025. Nevertheless, the company still releases regular security updates and bugfixes.

`Feature releases` are launched monthly. They have new attributes just as same as bugfixes.

Canonical LTD supports the software by releasing regular updates. Companies and developers can consult Canonical Ltd in case of any issues.

### Conclusion
To sum up, LXD containers have great features compared to traditional Linux containers. It significant benefits including better security, scalability, equipped with a powerful REST APIs.

Besides, LXD containers accommodate more servers compared to other virtual containers thus, making them more preferable to users. Another key advantage is that, they are supported by many Linux distributions worlwide. The availability of multiple storage volumes and pools make them suitable for many systems.

LXD releases have also made it stand out since they are launched regularly. I would highly recommend the use of LXD container managers.
